      <description>Greetings everyone, it has been a few weeks since our last posts. You may (or may not) have already noticed, I changed the theme of our blog as this one looks more professional and less boring than the old Chirpy theme I had used. But the new theme switch is not the sole reason for this update.
We all know that learning advanced English is an arduous journey, so recently I have read my colleagues&#39; writing tasks and, specifically, secret.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Greetings everyone, it has been a few weeks since our last posts. You may (or may not) have already noticed, I changed the theme of our blog as this one looks more professional and less boring than the old Chirpy theme I had used. But the new theme switch is not the sole reason for this update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know that learning advanced English is an arduous journey, so recently I have read my colleagues&#39; writing tasks and, specifically, &lt;a href=&#34;https://secret.club/&#34;&gt;secret.club&lt;/a&gt; whose novel style has followed an intriguingly clinical tone. All of their posts are explicit, logical and consistent, which really inspires me to reevaluate and improve my English writing, or professional progress in particular. On that account, I decided to spend more time learning and practicing their style of writing. Perhaps, you can learn something from it too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In future releases, I am planning on doing some exercises in the &lt;em&gt;Practical Reverse Engineering&lt;/em&gt; book of &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/brucedang&#34;&gt;Bruce Dang&lt;/a&gt; in order to dig deeper into Windows kernel-level as well as understand its complex functionalities. It is undoubtedly time-consuming and interesting at the same time since I love reversing and being able to see my endeavors payoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s all I wanted to say for now. Thanks for reading and see you in other posts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Welcome to my personal blog where I can share to people my thoughts and experience about (mostly) technology, research articles and sometimes irrelevant stuff.
Topics on this blog are mainly about cyber research, school projects, club tasks or CTF write-ups. I will try to keep the blog updated regularly, one or two posts a week depend on my real life workload.
As some of you have already known that it is not my first blog.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my personal blog where I can share to people my thoughts and experience about (mostly) technology, research articles and sometimes irrelevant stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Topics on this blog are mainly about cyber research, school projects, club tasks or CTF write-ups. I will try to keep the blog updated regularly, one or two posts a week depend on my real life workload.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As some of you have already known that it is not my first blog. The reason I created this new one is to improve my English and keeping thing a little bit more professional. I decided that the writing style on this blog will contain concise, research-like materials so you may find it difficult to understand all of the posts, especially my Vietnamese fellows. Please noted that I don&amp;rsquo;t want to use any fancy, magic words or try to confuse the readers. The context is still the same, but it will be interpreted in a more academic way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know a lot of people cannot handle the long, visually unstimulating wall-of-text, &lt;em&gt;so do I&lt;/em&gt;. In future posts, many more galleries, formats will be added to make particular topics more interesting and less drowsy for readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another story which is worth mentioning, now I completely abandoned Medium since Github and Jekyll are doing a great job making blog easier and more customizable. Then why we have to make it harder for ourselves, right? I agree that it is complicated at first but when you are used to it, everything&amp;rsquo;s changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the end of the README on this blog. Have a good day!&lt;/p&gt;
