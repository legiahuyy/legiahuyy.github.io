      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s have a quick and succinct write-up for orw - a challenge at pwnable.tw.&#xA;Footprinting Initially, we want to check the file for any notable properties (PIE, Canary, RELRO, etc.).&#xA;Based on the output above, there are no protection bits enabled within the binary (except for canary but it does not interfere with our payload afterwards) and therefore it is presumably believed to be quite simple as expected for a 100pts challenge.</description>

      <description>Foreword Greetings, this series of posts delves into a collection of pwnie solutions that I have been poking around for a while and finally have the time to publish it so that I could practice my writing and attempt to share some knowledge in such a way that could be helpful to others. Not to mention that I am also a rookie in this field, so take my words with a grain of salt and all critics/suggestions are welcome.</description>
