      <description>C was the only go-to programming language when you enter the kernel realm, see that I specifically used was and not has been? It is now the time to switch out that old, (t)rusty C11 to a newer, more futuristic C++17 standard and start playing with those sweet, sweet, juicy std::vector, std::string, std::tuple you all deserve like a good boy! Sorry I was just messing around, no way that can be happening this soon, not at least a few centuries decades to come and actually I know some people would even threaten you if they were to see those quirky lambdas in your driver code.</description>
