      <description>Foreword Greetings, this series of posts delves into a collection of pwnie solutions that I have been poking around for a while and finally have the time to publish it so that I could practice my writing and attempt to share some knowledge in such a way that could be helpful to others. Not to mention that I am also a rookie in this field, so take my words with a grain of salt and all critics/suggestions are welcome.</description>
