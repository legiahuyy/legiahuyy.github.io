    <h1>Burnt out</h1>

    

    <p>It must have been more than a year and a half since my last post on this site. A lot of things have changed during my absence: I got a job, and it has been pretty good so far, at least. It&rsquo;s not like there is something wrong with my life at the moment; you just get a little burnt out, but sooner or later, things will get back on track again&hellip; or that&rsquo;s just what other people, and even I, thought. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know till it happens to you,&rdquo; and it finally got to me. It was nothing at first, but slowly I started to feel bored with everything. I&rsquo;ve been trying to learn something, find a new hobby, play a couple of League matches with friends, but only after a few days (or hours), I lose interest again. I remember back then whenever I felt bored I could try doing what I usually did for entertainment, now everything makes me tired, then all I eventually do for the entire day is to start zoning out and do nothing. Maybe I really <em>do</em> need those idling time, or maybe I can&rsquo;t handle myself being unproductive.. you tell me.</p>
<p>All that rantings yet I also intend to post more about Windows kernel and even bootloader since I did invest a great amount of time researching these subjects. Hopefully this awful sensation soon goes away as it makes me feel like crap sitting here writing this for god-knows-who no offense, though.</p>
