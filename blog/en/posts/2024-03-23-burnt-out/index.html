    <h1>Burnt out</h1>

    

    <p>It must have been more than a year and a half since my last post on this site. A lot of things have changed during my absence: I got a job, and it has been pretty good so far, at least. It&rsquo;s not like there is something wrong with my life at the moment; you just get a little burnt out, but sooner or later, things will get back on track again&hellip; or that&rsquo;s just what other people, and even I, thought. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know till it happens to you,&rdquo; and it finally got to me. It was nothing at first, but slowly I started to feel bored with everything. I&rsquo;ve been trying to learn something new, find a new hobby, play a couple of League matches with friends, but only after a few days, I lose interest again. Whenever I try to do what I usually did for entertainment, now just looking at it makes me sick, and all I did was sit there and do nothing. Maybe I really <em>do</em> need those idling time, or maybe I can&rsquo;t handle myself being unproductive; you tell me.</p>
<p>All that rantings aside, I also intend to post more about Windows kernel, bootloaders stuff since I did a great research on these subjects, I was gone for too long after all. Hopefully, this awful sensation soon goes away. It feels like crap even sitting here writing this for god-knows-who readers (no offense, though).</p>
